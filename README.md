### Submarine Game
In levels 2, 3, and 4, the player controls a submarine to help the main characters collect garbage. By pressing and holding down on the screen, the player can extend the claw of the submarine to grab each new item. Each time a trash item is collected, its name and category is displayed for the player to remember.

### Sorting Game 
After the player collects the garbage at levels 2, 3 and 4, the player sorts all of them at level 5. By dragging the garbage item into the corresponding trash bin, the player can enhance their sorting knowledge they learned in the submarine game in levels 2, 3 and 4. A reminder will pop up if the garbage item is not placed in the correct trash bin.
